Denali DL4 DRIVING LIGHT PODS
</h3>    
<p>
    Introducing the brightest and most durable motorcycle driving 
    lights that won't break the bank. Engineered based on a decade of 
    customer feedback, our DL Series Driving Lights are purpose-built to 
    deliver best-in-class beam performance, unmatched durability, and our 
    signature dimming technology at a price point that is more approachable 
    to new riders, younger riders, and our rapidly growing international 
    customer base!

<h3>
Features:
</h3>    
<ul>
    <li>
        HiDrive LEDs 6,800 Lumens Per Pair – Top-bin CREE LEDs driven at 8 watts each deliver a remarkably powerful beam in a beefy 9-LED square package.
    </li>    
    <li>
        Oversized TIR Optics - Perfected Hybrid Driving Beam – Our proprietary TIR optics distribute the beam of light more efficiently than traditional reflector optics, giving our driving beam unmatched distance and width from the most compact housing possible.
    </li>   
    <li>
        DataDim™ Plug-&-Play Dimming – Our signature 3-wire design uses dedicated dimming wiring for maximum reliability and plug-&-play connection to all DENALI light harnesses, DialDim, and CANsmart Controllers.
    </li>    
    <li>
        DrySeal™ Sealed Beam Construction – Our patented technique robotically seals the lens and uses internal potting at the cable entry to guarantee 100% waterproof submersible performance even when connectors are removed.
    </li>    
    <li>
        Overbuilt Not Overpriced – Our 4mm thick powder-coated steel brackets & robust heatsink enable an impressive 21grms vibration rating, while our Polycarbonate lenses are reinforced with UV hard coating.
    </li>    
    <li>
        ECE Compliant Driving Beam – Our hybrid driving beam is ECE certified for street-legal use as a primary or auxiliary high beam in the European Union. Yellow and amber lenses are not compliant for street-legal high beam use.
